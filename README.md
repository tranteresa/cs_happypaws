# HappyPaws

## What is HappyPaws?
Happy Paws is a design concept project centered on a SaaS mobile app. 

Technology is transforming the way we interact with the world around us. HappyPaws is here to bring your best pal along for the adventure. This application is designed to help dog owners organize information, discover dog-friendly establishments, and connect to a diverse community through social events and outdoor activities.

## My Role
I created the concept, research, and design for this mobile application.
